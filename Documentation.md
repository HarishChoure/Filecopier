# Asked user to while file should we copied
# If copy is not exist than print"File does not exist"
# If copy is present than call the filecopy function

--filecopy Function Algorithm

# File copy System get parameter as a file name
# Then we create a new file ,which name is same as current file name but only one thing is added at end of file name i.e'-copy'
# Then new file is goes under the loop and in the loop we checked all the posiblites copies of current file and updated new file name
# After looping we copied data from one file to another file
